# Light-remote
Mimics a remote control to toggle my RF controlled lightbulb via a website stored on the microcontroller. (The remote that came with the bulb broke, so I decided to make my own). 

My first IoT project where I was first introduced to C++, microcontrollers, networking, and the remote control of a device.
# Hardware
I used a NodeMCU ESP-12 (Microcontroller) and an LRF24L01 (RF Transceiver).
